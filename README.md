Calculate moment of inertia (MOI) measurement for your cricket bat.

This Repo provides the means for you to generate a moment of inertia (MOI) measurement for your cricket bat.  MOI is the quantified value of the phenomena that cricketers refer to qualitatively as ‘swingweight’ or ‘pick up’.
In the future all cricket bats may be sold with this value provided and it will help you optimise your bat selection.
